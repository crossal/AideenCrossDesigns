			The bride can choose from Aideen's couture collection of wedding gowns on 
			show at her studio in Kildare or decide to have a completely original dress 
			designed by incorporating the brides own ideas with Aideen's expert advice and
			experience, to create a totally unique wedding gown that will reflect the brides 
			own personality and style. Aideen reminds each bride not to forget that their 
			family and friends will want to see the real you on your big day.

			Aideen works closely with each bride, giving them plenty of time to discuss all 
			aspects of the dress with her. Aideen is renowned for her attention to detail, 
			use of exquisite fabrics and her honest, genuine and friendly nature.

			All of Aideen's creations are designed and produced at her studio in Rathangan.

			appointment.
